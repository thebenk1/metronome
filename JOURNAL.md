## 10/29/2025 - I finished the schematic  

I finished the schematic of the metronome. I'm not super proud because it's not neat and lest be honest i probably wired so many things wrong (please let me know if I did).![Screenshot 2025-10-29 at 08.28.16](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQ1MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b4f802bf9fa825ef75461ca0d007d524bbb7113b/Screenshot%202025-10-29%20at%2008.28.16.png)
